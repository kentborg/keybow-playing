/*! Module for Keybow 12-key illuminated keypad.
 *
 * Keybow is a 12-key keypad with RGB LEDs under each key, that mounts
 * onto a Rapsberry Pi Zero. Or, probably better described as the very
 * small Pi Zero mounts onto it.
 *
 * The LEDs are set over SPI and the keys are read over GPIO.
 *
 * The Keybow is no longer manufactured. For more info:
 * <https://shop.pimoroni.com/en-us/products/keybow>
 *
 * # This module supports writing to the LEDs, and reading from the keys.
 *
 * Note: Functions for setting LEDs are a two-part thing.
 *
 * - First, set the desired color in the "off-screen frame buffer",
 *   and
 *
 * - Second, updating the physical LEDs to reflect this off-screen
 *   data.
 *
 * Apologies for pretending a humble illuminated key pad as a fancy
 * mega-pixel display.
 *
 *
